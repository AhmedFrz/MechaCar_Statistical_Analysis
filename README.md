```

### Why This Methodology?

This approach combines both descriptive and inferential statistics to address the research questions:

1. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Chosen to identify relationships between multiple vehicle design variables and MPG performance simultaneously, allowing isolation of significant factors while controlling for others.

2. **Summary Statistics by Grouping**: Used to quantify manufacturing consistency across different production lots, enabling targeted quality improvement.

3. **T-Tests**: Selected for statistical comparison against design specifications, providing objective evidence of compliance or deviation from standards.

This statistical framework provides a robust, data-driven approach to identify both performance factors and manufacturing issues.

### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The analysis revealed that vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically significant predictors of MPG performance (p < 0.05). The multiple R-squared value indicates the model explains a substantial portion of the variation in MPG, suggesting these design elements should be prioritized in vehicle development.
