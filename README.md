Questions to answer: 

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle , AWD provided a non-random amount of variance

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No it is not considered to be zero as p-value is 5.35


3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
R-squared is 71.49% and it means independent variables explains 71.49% of the changes in dependent variable  and hence it predict effectively.
